To my beloved parents, to whom I owe everything, for their constant sacrifices, love, and encouragement that have allowed me to pursue my dreams. This work is offered to them in gratitude for providing a peaceful and nurturing environment essential for the completion of this thesis.  

To my dear Sabrine, Mouayed, and Khalil, whose love and encouragement have been my anchor throughout this journey. Your belief in me has been an endless source of strength and inspiration.  

A heartfelt thank you goes to all my professors and mentors who guided me through every step of this project, offering invaluable advice and wisdom.
